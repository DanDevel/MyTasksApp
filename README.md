# MyTasksApp
Tasks App Demo

This is a task management application developed in React with the Chakra UI component library for styling and a backend API created with Express.js and Sequelize, using PostgreSQL as the database. The application allows the user to view, create, edit, and delete tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js, npm, and PostgreSQL installed on your machine.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using https://github.com/DanDevel/MyTasksApp .

Navigate to the repository folder on your machine and install all necessary dependencies using the npm install command.

Set up the PostgreSQL database according to the settings in the config/db.config.js file.

Start the backend server using npm run start:server.

Start the frontend server using npm start.

The application should now be running and available for access at http://localhost:3000.
The NODE SERVER.JS should now be running and available for access at http://localhost:8080.
